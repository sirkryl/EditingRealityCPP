Text size and positioning change on 1280x720 (tablet):

- Wall text move down
- Percent and Status msg too close to one another (maybe increase status rectangle in the middle?)
- Check buttons for consistency
- ROTATE/SCALE AND MOUSE PLACEMENT IS FUCKED UP IN 1280x720 - probably wrong Cursorposition Calculation somewhere?
- Adjust Selection Mode to Tablet Touchcontrols (look above) in Tabletmode
