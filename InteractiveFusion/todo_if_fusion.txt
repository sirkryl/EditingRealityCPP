tap = left click
hold = right click
drag = drag & drop
drag up down -> window scroll



Text size and positioning change on 1280x720 (tablet):


- Percent and Status msg too close to one another (maybe increase status rectangle in the middle?)
- Check buttons for consistency
- Adjust Selection Mode to Tablet Touchcontrols (look above) in Tabletmode
- SCALE/ROTATE etc should be different on tablet (maybe fix object in the center of screen and rotate with drag and drop and scale with zoom)
